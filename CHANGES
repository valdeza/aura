* Logger renamed to Log.
* Log logs everything to files now, and hides messages only from the command line.
* Log.Exception can give an error message, which is not hidden by adding Exception to Hide.
* Packet handler is its own class now, that the server is decorated with.
* Packet handlers are defined with an attribute.
